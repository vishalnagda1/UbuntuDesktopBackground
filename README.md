# UbuntuDesktopBackground (UDB)
This shell script is written to create a new XML file which displays your own selected pictures for your Ubuntu desktop background.

# Help For This File :
OPEN TERMINAL AND TYPE sudo -i AND NOW ENTER YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD.
NOW LOCATE THE DIRECOTRY THAT CONTAIN UDB.sh FILE.
COPY THIS FILE AND ALL YOUR NEW BACKGROUND IMAGES TO THE DIRECTORY /usr/share/backgrounds/
NOW LOCATE THE DIRECTORY /usr/share/backgrounds/contest (THIS DIRECTORY MAY BE DIFFERENT IN YOUR CASE, COZ I'M USING UBUNTU 16.04 LTS i.e. XENIAL XERUS).
MAKE A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL FILE xenial.xml (THIS FILE MAY ALSO BE DIFFERENT IN YOUR CASE).
NOW GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS DIRECTORY AND RUN UDB.sh FILE BY TYPING IN TERMINAL ./UDB.sh
DONE
